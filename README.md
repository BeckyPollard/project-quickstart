# Becky's empty project template
Template for personal projects, for quick coding starts.

## ⭐️ Features
- Webpack 5
- SCSS
- TypeScript
- React

## 🏗 Setting it up
1. Click "USE THIS TEMPLATE" and generate your new project.
2. Clone down that new repo, or whatever you wanna do to get the code.
3. Install dependencies `npm i`

## 🚀 Run the project
To run the localhost development server:
`npm start`

## 📦 Prepping project for production
To bundle everything for production, run:
`npm run build`

SCSS will be converted to CSS, TSX will be converted to JS, images will be collected into **/build/assets/images**... all good things will be bundled and ready to rock!

## 🖤 Special thanks
Special thanks to freeCodeCamp and Colt Steele for producing a wonderful [Webpack for Beginners course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpGLUVbqoYQ). Learnings from that course have been applied here to make this project possible.

Inspiration for BeckyBot from [Mark Wilkins](https://github.com/mwilkins91). Thank you for providing us at Arson Team with excellent code to learn from!

Thanks to [Evert Pot](https://github.com/evert) for teaching me React and TypeScript!
