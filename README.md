# Becky's empty project template with Webpack
Template for personal projects, for quick coding starts.

## Setting it up
1. Clone down the repo, or whatever you wanna do to get the code.
2. Install dependancies `npm i`

## Run the project
To run the local host for updating development and scss compile:
`npm start`

## Prepping project for production
To bundle everything for production, run:
`npm run build`

CSS and JS will be bundled, file names will have a hash added for cache busting, images will be collected into **/build/assets/images**.

## Special thanks
Special thanks to freeCodeCamp and Colt Steele for producing a wonderful [Webpack for Beginners course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpGLUVbqoYQ). Learnings from that course have been applied here to make this project possible.

Inspiration for BeckyBot from [Mark Wilkins](https://github.com/mwilkins91). Thank you for providing us with excellent code to learn from.
